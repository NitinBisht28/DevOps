# DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning journey repository! Here, I'll be documenting my exploration and experimentation with various DevOps tools, practices, and concepts.

## About

This repository serves as a centralized hub where I'll be storing all the code, configurations, and notes related to my DevOps learning journey. From mastering Linux commands to orchestrating containers with Kubernetes, I aim to cover a wide range of topics in the DevOps domain.

## Contents

### 1. Learning Resources

- **Books**: I'll list down the DevOps books I'm reading and my key takeaways from each.
- **Online Courses**: Any online courses or tutorials I'm following will be documented here along with my progress.
- **Blogs/Articles**: Interesting blog posts or articles related to DevOps that I come across will be shared in this section.

### 2. Projects

I'll be working on various projects to apply the DevOps principles in real-world scenarios. Each project will have its dedicated folder containing the code, configurations, and documentation.

### 3. Tools and Technologies

- **Linux**: Mastering essential Linux commands, shell scripting, and system administration tasks.
- **Git**: Version control using Git for managing codebase and collaboration.
- **YAML**: Understanding YAML syntax for writing configuration files, particularly used in tools like Kubernetes.
- **Kubernetes**: Exploring container orchestration with Kubernetes, including deployments, services, and scaling.
- **Docker**: Containerization using Docker for packaging applications and their dependencies.

<!-- Further topics will be added as the journey progresses. -->

### 4. Learning Logs

I'll maintain a learning log where I'll jot down my daily/weekly progress, challenges faced, and lessons learned throughout this journey.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide feedback/suggestions on how I can improve my learning journey. Collaboration and knowledge sharing are highly encouraged!

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express my gratitude to the amazing DevOps community for sharing their knowledge and resources, which have been immensely helpful in my learning journey.

Let's embark on this DevOps journey together and strive for continuous improvement and automation!
